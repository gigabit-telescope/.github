# GigaBIT Telescope

GigaBIT, Gigapixel-class Balloon-borne Imaging Telescope, is a three-mirror anastigmat (TMA) system with a 1.35-m primary mirror designed to perform wide-field imaging with diffraction limited resolutions in the near ultraviolet (NUV) over a 0.8-deg field of view.
GigaBIT aims to launch with NASA's Superpressure Balloon in the coming years.
